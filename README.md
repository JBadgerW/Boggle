Just a very simple script to search a Boggle ... board? play? instance? frame? ... and return all the scoring words.

It is hard-coded at the moment for a particular frame.

If you run it with a different word list, you should run cull_words.py first in order to create new lists of 3- to 16-letter words.

Word list from here: https://github.com/benhoyt/boggle/blob/master/word-list.txt
